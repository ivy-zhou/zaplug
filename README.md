# ZAPLUG
ZAPLUG is a superhero shaped like a power plug!
Play by downloading the zip file, extracting, and opening the `index.html` file, or see it live [here](https://ivy-zhou.github.io/demo/zaplug/zaplug.html).

## Issues
- Graphics for the player and Zaplug have blank spaces at top and bottom, so I have made a quick fix in changing the x and y orientation, but it will make for cleaner code later on if we have proper graphics for it
- Sandworm collision direction is technically incorrect since the sandworm dimensions change every frame
- Should not just freeze the game for game over

## Features to Implement
- Dialogue, storyline + other levels
- Menu screen
